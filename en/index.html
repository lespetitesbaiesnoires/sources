    <p>The vineyards are located in the center of the Corbières massif where
    vineyards , olives trees and truffle oaks are the only possible culture. Ten
    years ago Jean-Marie Espeut started to cultivate the vineyards owned by his
    family since three generations. He selected the best parcels for Syrah and
    Mourvèdre in the mountains of the little village Saint Laurent de la
    Cabrerisse. That soil is rich on clay and chalk.</p>
    <p>This area has very low rainfall and a North-West wind called "Cers" are
    limiting the use of treatments.</p>
    <p>The soils are plough, grapes are manually picked up in a first selection
    in the vineyards and then transported in crates. A second selection
    followed in the wine cellar. The berries are after that poured manually into
    tanks of 500 gallons each. At the beginning of the fermentation punching of
    berries ( pigeage) is frequently performed manually and then in longer 
    intervals. The fermentation time takes 21 days for the Mourvèdre and 26 days
    for the Syrah. Half of the harvest is aging in new oak barrels for about 9
    month.</p>
